[00:13.96]Think of me when you're out, when you're out there
[00:20.44]I'll beg you nice from my knees
[00:27.12]And when the world treats you way too fairly
[00:33.78]Well, it's a shame I'm a dream
[00:41.07]
[00:41.07]All I wanted was you
[00:47.78]All I wanted was you
[01:07.10]
[01:07.10]I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
[01:13.79]And fall asleep on the couch
[01:20.44]And wake up early to black-and-white reruns
[01:27.33]That escaped from my mouth (oh, oh)
[01:34.40]
[01:34.40]All I wanted was you
[01:41.03]All I wanted was you
[01:47.71]All I wanted was you
[01:54.38]All I wanted was you
[02:13.90]
[02:13.90]I could follow you to the beginning
[02:20.57]Just to relive the start
[02:27.15]And maybe then we'd remember to slow down
[02:33.76]At all of our favorite parts
[02:41.01]
[02:41.01]All I wanted was you
[02:47.70]All I wanted was you
[02:54.41]All I wanted was you
[03:01.04]All I wanted was you
[03:07.70]All I wanted was you
