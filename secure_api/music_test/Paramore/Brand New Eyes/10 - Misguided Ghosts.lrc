[00:19.85]I'm going away for a while
[00:22.36]But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
[00:26.51]Cause I'll return as soon as possible
[00:29.15]See I'm trying to find my place
[00:31.49]But it might not be here where I feel safe
[00:35.67]We all learn to make mistakes
[00:38.20]
[00:38.20]And run
[00:39.90]From them, from them
[00:44.56]With no direction
[00:47.38]We'll run from them, from them
[00:53.70]With no conviction
[00:56.13]
[00:56.13]Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
[01:01.76]Traveling endlessly
[01:06.94]Don't need no roads
[01:11.82]In fact they follow me
[01:18.01]
[01:18.01]And we just go in circles
[01:22.55]
[01:22.55]Well now I'm told that this is life
[01:25.07]And pain is just a simple compromise
[01:28.88]So we can get what we want out of it
[01:31.77]Would someone care to classify,
[01:34.02]Our broken hearts and twisted minds
[01:36.17]So I can find someone to rely on
[01:40.59]
[01:40.59]And run
[01:41.92]To them, to them
[01:47.42]Full speed ahead
[01:49.52]Oh you are not, useless
[01:55.73]We are just
[01:58.49]
[01:58.49]Misguided ghosts
[02:03.34]Traveling endlessly
[02:07.97]The ones we trusted the most
[02:13.08]Pushed us far away
[02:17.85]And there's no one road
[02:22.92]And we should not be the same
[02:28.03]But I'm just a ghost
[02:32.44]And still they echo me
[02:39.73]
[02:39.73]They echo me in circles
