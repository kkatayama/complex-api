[00:21.04]When I was younger
[00:23.20]I saw my daddy cry
[00:27.30]And curse at the wind
[00:31.34]He broke his own heart
[00:33.39]And I watched
[00:35.16]As he tried to reassemble it
[00:41.58]
[00:41.58]And my momma swore
[00:43.82]That she would never let herself forget
[00:52.26]And that was the day that I promised
[00:56.18]I'd never sing of love
[00:58.67]If it does not exist, but darlin'
[01:02.95]
[01:02.95]You are, the only exception
[01:07.70]While you are, the only exception
[01:12.96]While you are, the only exception
[01:18.14]While you are, the only exception
[01:28.63]
[01:28.63]While maybe I know, somewhere
[01:32.67]Deep in my soul
[01:35.14]That love never lasts
[01:38.93]And we've got to find other ways
[01:42.99]To make it alone
[01:45.68]Or keep a straight face
[01:49.42]
[01:49.42]And I've always lived like this
[01:53.47]And Keeping it comfortable, distance
[01:59.95]And up until now
[02:02.01]I had sworn to myself that I'm content
[02:06.48]With loneliness
[02:10.08]
[02:10.08]Because none of it was ever worth the risk
[02:13.10]
[02:13.10]While you are, the only exception
[02:18.31]While you are, the only exception
[02:23.48]While you are, the only exception
[02:28.67]While you are, the only exception
[02:54.25]
[02:54.25]I've got a tight grip on reality
[02:57.42]But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
[03:04.60]I know your leaving in the morning, when you wake up
[03:09.96]Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh
[03:21.03]
[03:21.03]You are, the only exception
[03:26.17]You are, the only exception
[03:31.57]You are, the only exception
[03:36.42]While you are, the only exception
[03:41.82]
[03:41.82]You are, the only exception
[03:46.92]While you are, the only exception
[03:52.46]You are, the only exception
[03:57.24]While you are, the only exception
[04:02.46]
[04:02.46]And I'm on my way to believing
[04:11.76]Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
