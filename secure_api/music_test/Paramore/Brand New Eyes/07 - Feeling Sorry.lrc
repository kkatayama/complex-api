[00:15.00]We still live in the same town, well, don't we?
[00:18.17]But I don't see you around anymore
[00:22.07]I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you
[00:26.55]Your days are numbered at twenty four
[00:29.59]And as I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
[00:33.38]We're not getting any younger, and I
[00:37.15]Won't look back 'cause there's no use
[00:40.77]It's time to move forward
[00:43.99]
[00:43.99]I feel no sympathy
[00:47.86]You live inside a cave
[00:51.36]You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
[00:54.40]There's no need to apologize
[00:56.37]I've got no time for feeling sorry
[01:13.26]
[01:13.26]Well, I tried not to think of what might happen
[01:17.01]When your reality, it finally cuts through
[01:20.82]Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
[01:24.89]The worst part is that this (this), this could be you
[01:28.68]You know it too, you can't run from your shame
[01:32.25]You're not getting any younger, time
[01:36.02]Keeps passing by, but you waited awake
[01:39.47]It's time to roll over
[01:42.92]
[01:42.92]I feel no sympathy
[01:46.51]You live inside a cave
[01:50.09]You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
[01:53.31]There's no need to apologize
[01:55.25]I've got no time for feeling sorry
[01:58.84]
[01:58.84]And all the best lies
[02:02.29]They are told with fingers tied
[02:05.28]So cross them tight
[02:07.41]Won't you promise me tonight
[02:11.32]If it's the last thing you do, you'll get out
[02:17.66]
[02:17.66]I feel no sympathy
[02:21.54]You live inside a cave
[02:24.91]You barely get by the rest of us are trying
[02:28.10]There's no need to apologize
[02:30.01]I've got no time, I've got no time
[02:32.32]
[02:32.32]I feel no sympathy
[02:36.06]You live inside a cave
[02:39.71]You barely get by the rest of us are trying
[02:42.88]There's no need to apologize
[02:44.90]Got no time
[02:52.54]
[02:52.54]I've got no time for feeling sorry
[02:59.50]I've got no time for feeling sorry
