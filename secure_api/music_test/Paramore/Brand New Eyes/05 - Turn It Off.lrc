[00:18.12]I scraped my knees while I was praying
[00:22.43]And found a demon in my safest haven, seems like
[00:26.90]It's getting harder to believe in anything
[00:30.51]Then just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
[00:35.24]I wanna know what it'd be like
[00:39.38]To find perfection in my pride
[00:41.87]To see nothing in the light
[00:44.15]But turn it off
[00:46.15]In all my spite
[00:48.71]In all my spite
[00:50.86]I'll turn it off
[00:52.43]
[00:52.43]And the worst part is
[00:55.02]Before it gets any better
[00:57.95]We're headed for a cliff
[01:00.84]And in the free fall I will realize
[01:05.04]I'm better off when I hit the bottom
[01:18.50]
[01:18.50]The tragedy, it seems unending
[01:22.34]I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
[01:26.67]We're taking shortcuts and false solutions
[01:30.46]Just to come out the hero
[01:35.22]Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
[01:39.75]The wheels are cranking, turning, so on the way we're working
[01:43.72]Towards a goal, that's non existent
[01:47.91]It's not existent, but we just keep believing
[01:52.38]
[01:52.38]And the worst part is
[01:55.01]Before it gets any better
[01:58.00]We're headed for a cliff
[02:00.94]And in the free fall I will realize
[02:05.08]I'm better off when I hit the bottom
[02:27.00]
[02:27.00]I wanna know what it'd be like
[02:30.83]To find perfection in my pride
[02:33.28]To see nothing in the light
[02:35.53]But turn it off
[02:37.60]In all my spite
[02:40.08]In all my spite
[02:42.11]I'll turn it off
[02:43.96]Just turn it off
[02:47.03]
[02:47.03]Again
[02:53.69]Again
[03:03.24]
[03:03.24]And the worst part is
[03:05.67]Before it gets any better
[03:08.62]We're headed for a cliff
[03:11.70]And in the free fall I will realize
[03:15.80]I'm better off when I hit the bottom
[03:20.40]
[03:20.40]And the worst part is
[03:22.91]Before it gets any better
[03:25.92]We're headed for a cliff
[03:28.75]And in the free fall I will realize
[03:32.97]I'm better off when I hit the bottom
