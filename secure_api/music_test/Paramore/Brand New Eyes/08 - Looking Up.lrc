[00:19.34]Things are looking up, oh, finally
[00:23.28]I thought I'd never see the day
[00:26.78]When you smile at me
[00:28.63]We always pull through, oh, when we try
[00:33.65]I'm always wrong but you're never right
[00:37.44]Oh, you're never right
[00:41.68]
[00:41.68]Honestly, can you believe
[00:44.17]We crossed the world while it's asleep?
[00:46.48]I'd never trade it in, 'cause I've always wanted this
[00:51.01]And it's not a dream anymore
[00:54.38]No, it's not a dream anymore
[00:59.22]It's worth fighting for
[01:11.24]
[01:11.24]Could have given up so easily
[01:14.74]I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
[01:19.59]Taken for granted, almost everything that I would have died for
[01:26.92]Just yesterday
[01:29.20]Just yesterday
[01:33.20]
[01:33.20]Honestly, can you believe
[01:35.54]We crossed the world while it's asleep?
[01:37.97]I'd never trade it in, 'cause I've always wanted this
[01:42.33]And, it's not a dream anymore
[01:45.78]No, it's not a dream anymore
[01:50.75]It's worth fighting for
[01:54.87]
[01:54.87]God knows the world doesn't need another band, whoa, whoa
[01:59.88]But what a waste it would've been, whoa, whoa
[02:04.98]I can't believe we almost hung it up, whoa, whoa
[02:09.82]We're just getting started, whoa, whoa
[02:19.04]
[02:19.04]Honestly, can you believe
[02:22.09]We crossed the world while it's asleep?
[02:24.61]I'd never trade it in, 'cause I've always wanted this
[02:29.07]And it's not a dream anymore
[02:32.23]No, it's not a dream anymore
[02:37.07]No, it's not a dream anymore
[02:42.08]No, it's not a dream anymore
[02:47.01]It's worth fighting for
[02:53.69]
[02:53.69]I can't believe we almost hung it up whoa, whoa
[02:58.65]We're just getting started, whoa, whoa
[03:03.72]I can't believe we almost hung it up, whoa, whoa
