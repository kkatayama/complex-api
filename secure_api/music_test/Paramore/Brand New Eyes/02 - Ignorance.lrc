[00:22.78]If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
[00:25.78]Well, I guess I'll make my own way
[00:28.44]It's a circle, a mean cycle
[00:31.22]I can't excite you anymore
[00:33.90]
[00:33.90]Where's your gavel? Your jury?
[00:36.88]What's my offense this time?
[00:39.50]You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
[00:42.29]Well, sentence me to another life
[00:45.27]
[00:45.27]Don't wanna hear your sad songs
[00:46.99]I don't wanna feel your pain
[00:48.26]When you swear it's all my fault
[00:49.85]'Cause you know we're not the same (no)
[00:51.60]We're not the same (no)
[00:53.21]Oh, we're not the same
[00:56.47]Yeah, the friends who stuck together
[00:58.23]We wrote our names in blood
[00:59.49]But I guess you can't accept that the change is good (hey)
[01:02.99]It's good (hey), it's good
[01:10.34]
[01:10.34]Well, you treat me just like another stranger
[01:15.47]Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
[01:17.89]I guess I'll go
[01:19.28]I'd best be on my way out
[01:21.77]You treat me just like another stranger
[01:26.70]Well, it's nice to meet you, sir

[01:30.58]I'd best be on my way out
[01:32.84]
[01:32.84]Ignorance is your new best friend
[01:35.67]Ignorance is your new best friend
[01:38.43]
[01:38.43]This is the best thing that could have happened
[01:41.43]Any longer and I wouldn't have made it
[01:44.21]It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture
[01:47.05]I'm just a person, but you can't take it
[01:49.73]The same tricks that, that once fooled me
[01:52.62]They won't get you anywhere
[01:55.47]I'm not the same kid from your memory
[01:58.17]Well, now I can fend for myself
[02:01.11]
[02:01.11]Don't wanna hear your sad songs
[02:02.71]I don't wanna feel your pain
[02:04.22]When you swear it's all my fault
[02:05.64]'Cause you know we're not the same (no)
[02:07.37]We're not the same (no)
[02:08.97]Oh, we're not the same
[02:12.14]Yeah, we used to stick together
[02:14.03]We wrote our names in blood
[02:15.27]But I guess you can't accept that the change is good (hey)
[02:18.80]It's good (hey), it's good
[02:26.17]
[02:26.17]Well, you treat me just like another stranger
[02:31.29]Well, it's nice to meet you, sir

[02:51.43]Ignorance is your new best friend
[02:54.20]Ignorance is your new best friend
[02:57.02]Ignorance is your new best friend
[03:13.89]
[03:13.89]Well, you treat me just like another stranger
