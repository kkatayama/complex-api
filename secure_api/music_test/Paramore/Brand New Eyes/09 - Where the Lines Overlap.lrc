[00:06.05]Give me attention
[00:08.81]I need it now
[00:12.02]Too much distance
[00:14.76]To measure it out, out loud
[00:17.80]Chasing patterns across a personal map
[00:23.80]And making pictures where the line overlap
[00:29.91]Where the lines overlap
[00:32.79]
[00:32.79]No one is as lucky as us
[00:38.21]We're not at the end yet but we already won
[00:44.57]No one is as lucky as us
[00:52.27]Is as lucky as us
[00:56.94]
[00:56.94]Call me over, and tell me how
[01:02.56]Well you got so far
[01:05.69]Never making a single sound
[01:08.73]I'm not used to it
[01:11.59]But I can learn
[01:14.76]There's nothing to it
[01:17.85]I've never been happier
[01:20.85]Never been happier
[01:23.90]
[01:23.90]No one is as lucky as us
[01:29.43]We're not at the end yet but we already won
[01:35.42]No one is as lucky as us
[01:43.66]Is as lucky as us
[01:47.93]
[01:47.93]Now I've got a feeling if I sing this loud enough
[01:51.63]You would sing it back to me
[01:53.96]I've got a feeling if I sing this loud enough
[01:57.70]You would sing it back to me
[02:00.23]
[02:00.23]I've got a feeling
[02:01.40]I've got a feeling
[02:02.81]That you would sing it back to me
[02:06.44]That you would sing it back to me
[02:10.77]
[02:10.77]No one is as lucky as us
[02:15.34]We're not at the end yet but we already won
[02:21.27]Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
[02:29.89]Is as lucky as us
[02:33.06]Is as lucky as us
