[00:13.20]Can't make my own decisions
[00:16.39]Or make any with precision
[00:19.92]Well, maybe you should tie me up
[00:23.27]So I don't go where you don't want me
[00:27.00]
[00:27.00]You say that I've been changing
[00:30.18]That I'm not just simply ageing
[00:33.79]Yeah, how could that be logical?
[00:37.26]Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat
[00:41.27]
[00:41.27]Woah
[00:45.04]You don't have to believe me
[00:47.66]But the way I, way I see it
[00:51.98]Next time you point a finger
[00:53.86]I might have to bend it back
[00:55.35]And break it, break it off
[00:58.94]Next time you point a finger
[01:00.61]I'll point you to the mirror
[01:08.73]
[01:08.73]If God's the game that you're playing
[01:11.95]Well, we must get more acquainted
[01:15.47]Because it has to be so lonely
[01:18.89]To be the only one who's holy
[01:22.33]
[01:22.33]It's just my humble opinion
[01:25.84]But it's one that I believe in
[01:29.48]You don't deserve a point of view
[01:32.84]If the only thing you see is you
[01:36.74]
[01:36.74]Woah
[01:40.68]You don't have to believe me
[01:43.29]But the way I, way I see it
[01:47.52]Next time you point a finger
[01:49.15]I might have to bend it back
[01:51.00]And break it, break it off
[01:54.53]Next time you point a finger
[01:56.35]I'll point you to the mirror
[02:12.09]
[02:12.09]This is the last second chance
[02:13.79](I'll point you to the mirror)
[02:15.55]I'm half as good as it gets
[02:17.30](I'll point you to the mirror)
[02:19.03]I'm on both sides of the fence
[02:20.76](I'll point you to the mirror)
[02:22.50]Without a hint of regret
[02:24.21]I'll hold you to it
[02:25.95]
[02:25.95]I know you don't believe me
[02:28.44]But the way I, way I see it
[02:32.68]Next time you point a finger
[02:34.51]I might have to bend it back
[02:36.04]Or break it, break it off
[02:39.77]Next time you point a finger
[02:41.40]I'll point you to the mirror
[02:43.49]
[02:43.49]I know you won't believe me
[02:46.00]But the way I, way I see it
[02:50.18]Next time you point a finger
[02:51.73]I might have to bend it back
[02:53.42]And break it, break it off
[02:57.15]Next time you point a finger
[02:58.87]I'll point you to the mirror
