[00:23.53]I settled down
[00:24.65]A twisted up frown
[00:26.23]Disguised as a smile, well
[00:28.62]You would have never known
[00:31.99]
[00:31.99]I had it all
[00:33.47]But not what I wanted
[00:34.99]Cause hope for me
[00:36.16]Was a place uncharted
[00:37.75]And overgrown
[00:41.30]
[00:41.30]You'd make your way in
[00:43.35]I'd resist you just like this
[00:45.44]
[00:45.44]You can't tell me to feel
[00:47.33]The truth never set me free
[00:49.35]So, I did it myself
[00:52.25]
[00:52.25]You can't be too careful anymore
[00:56.04]When all that is waiting for you
[00:59.03]Won't come any closer
[01:01.80]You've got to reach out a little more
[01:06.93]More
[01:09.78]More
[01:12.65]More, more
[01:21.81]
[01:21.81]Open your eyes like I opened mine
[01:24.41]It's only the real world
[01:26.93]A life you will never know
[01:30.20]
[01:30.20]Shifting your weight
[01:31.72]To throw off the pain
[01:33.03]Well You can ignore it
[01:35.48]But, only for so long
[01:39.35]
[01:39.35]You look like I did
[01:41.67]You resist me just like this
[01:43.66]
[01:43.66]You can't tell me to heal
[01:45.54]And, it hurts remembering
[01:47.29]How it felt to shut down
[01:50.72]
[01:50.72]Can't be too careful anymore
[01:54.16]When all that is waiting for you
[01:57.08]Won't come any closer
[01:59.89]You've got to reach out a little more
[02:05.04]More
[02:07.99]More
[02:11.01]More, more
[02:37.81]
[02:37.81]Truth never set me free
[02:40.36]The truth never set me free
[02:43.24]The truth never set me free
[02:45.73]So, I'll do it myself
[02:56.33]
[02:56.33]You can't be too careful anymore
[02:59.58]When all that is waiting for you
[03:02.57]Won't come any closer
[03:05.34]You've got to reach out
[03:07.91]
[03:07.91]Can't be too careful anymore
[03:11.29]When all that is waiting for you

[03:19.47]More
