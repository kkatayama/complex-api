[00:00.62]War
[00:01.96]A war
[00:03.36]A war
[00:04.52]On the far side
[00:06.64]On the other side of the planet
[00:11.39]
[00:11.39]And I've got
[00:12.71]War
[00:13.99]A war
[00:15.38]A war
[00:16.68]Right behind my eyes
[00:18.84]Right behind 'em just like a headache
[00:24.11]
[00:24.11]So I turn on (the news)
[00:31.22]Turn off (the news)
[00:37.89]
[00:37.89]Every second, our collective heart breaks
[00:41.03]All together, every single head shakes
[00:44.07]Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
[00:46.83](Turn on, turn off, the news)
[00:50.04]
[00:50.04]Every second, our collective heart breaks

[00:59.03](Turn on, turn off, the news)
[01:01.24]
[01:01.24]Far
[01:02.31]I'm far
[01:03.65]So far
[01:05.14]From a front line
[01:07.47]Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside
[01:12.97]
[01:12.97]But I worry and I give money
[01:15.48]And I feel useless behind this computer
[01:18.62]And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind
[01:25.05]
[01:25.05]So I turn on (the news)
[01:31.99]Turn off (the news)
[01:38.15]Turn on (the news)

[02:03.02]
[02:03.02]Every second, our collective heart breaks
[02:06.10]All together, every single head shakes
[02:08.82]Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
[02:11.84](Turn on, turn off, the news)
[02:14.83]
[02:14.83]Exploitative
[02:16.39]Performative
[02:17.62]Informative
[02:18.58]And we don't know the half of it
[02:20.79]Rhetorical
[02:22.45]Deplorable
[02:23.71]Historical
[02:24.60]And all along, we call it normal
[02:27.08]
[02:27.08]Exploitative
