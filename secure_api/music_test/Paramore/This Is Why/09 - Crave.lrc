[00:28.90]I can't wait to memorize this day
[00:35.25]Oh, a picture could not contain the way it feels
[00:43.46]You say, "Live in the present"
[00:46.30]I'm already dreaming of how it begins
[00:49.93]And trying to savor the moment
[00:53.46]But I know the feeling will come to an end
[00:57.21]
[00:57.21]So I crave
[00:59.91]Crave to do it again, all again
[01:05.87]Crave, crave to do it again, I
[01:13.00]Just for a second it all felt simple
[01:16.24]I'm already missing it
[01:19.17]So I crave
[01:21.84]Crave to do it again, all again
[01:34.65]
[01:34.65]I romanticize even the worst of times
[01:41.32]When all it took to make me cry was being alive
[01:49.53]Look up and see a reflection of someone
[01:52.90]Who never gave way to the pain
[01:55.80]What if I told 'em that now that I'm older
[01:59.40]There isn't a moment that I'd wanna change
[02:03.17]
[02:03.17]Now I crave
[02:05.83]Crave to do it again, all again
[02:11.94]Crave, crave to do it again, I
[02:18.80]Just for a second it all felt simple
[02:22.16]I'm already missing it
[02:25.06]So I crave
[02:27.89]Crave to do it again, all again
[02:48.25]
[02:48.25]Any second feel the present
[02:51.68]Future and the past connecting
[02:55.45](Past connecting, past connecting)
[03:02.84]
[03:02.84]Any second feel the present
[03:06.34]Future and the past connecting
[03:10.23](Past connecting, past connecting)
[03:17.25]
[03:17.25]Crave, crave to do it again, all again (do it all again)
[03:25.04]Crave, crave to do it again, I
[03:32.05]Just for a second it all felt simple
[03:35.46]I'm already missing it
[03:38.31]So I crave
[03:41.23]Crave to do it again, all again
