[00:00.00]I am a magnet for broken pieces
[00:06.68]I am attracted to broken people
[00:13.27]I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
[00:19.20]And it looks like my fault
[00:25.66]And it looks like I'm caught red-handed
[00:33.00]
[00:33.00]Hit over the head, epiphany
[00:39.28]Over my head, repeatedly
[00:45.76]Thick skull never did nothing for me
[00:52.30]Same lesson again? Come on, give it to me
[00:58.94]Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
[01:23.00]
[01:23.00]Only I know where all the bodies are buried
[01:29.44]Thought by now I'd find 'em just a little less scary
[01:36.07]Might get easier but you don't get used to it
[01:41.70]Keep on autopilot, hey, hey
[01:50.17]What's the body count up to now, captain?
[01:55.35]
[01:55.35]Hit over the head, epiphany
[02:02.09]Over my head, repeatedly
[02:08.40]Thick skull never did nothing for me
[02:14.94]Same lesson again? Come on, give it to me
[02:21.82]Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
[02:42.00]
[02:42.00]Come on out with your hands up
[02:48.39]Come on out with your hands up
[02:54.86]I'm coming out with my hands up, oh
[03:01.57]Come on out with your hands up
[03:08.12]
[03:08.12]Hit over the head, epiphany
[03:14.68]Over my head, repeatedly
[03:21.33]Thick skull never did nothing for me
[03:27.93]Same lesson again? Come on, give it to me
[03:34.99]
[03:34.99]I pick 'em up (give it to me, give it to me)
[03:37.32]And now my fingers are bleeding (give it to me)
[03:41.18]And it looks like I'm caught red-handed
