[00:26.00]What was the moment? It's hard to say
[00:28.92]I'm sure I don't remember anyway
[00:32.39]Before I only knew to hesitate
[00:35.20]Pin back in the grenade
[00:38.20]And all the ways I'd keep you safe
[00:44.51]I keep you safe from me
[00:51.37]
[00:51.37]And, oh my love, I lied to you
[00:57.34]But I never needed to
[01:04.41]Oh my love, I lied to you
[01:10.34]But you always knew the truth
[01:24.48]
[01:24.48]I got too good at fighting chemicals
[01:27.70]And dodging arrows I was asking for
[01:30.67]Wading through the fog and then it disappeared
[01:33.68]Naked when I'm here
[01:36.74]And why should I deny what's all at once so crystal clear?
[01:49.58]
[01:49.58]And, oh my love, I lied to you
[01:55.81]But I never needed to
[02:02.89]Oh my love, I lied to you
[02:08.67]But you always knew the truth
[02:22.41]
[02:22.41]Love is not an easy thing to admit
[02:28.06]But I'm not ashamed of it
[02:35.48]Love is not a weakening
[02:37.55]If you feel it rushing in
[02:41.02]Don't be ashamed of it
[02:48.26]
[02:48.26]Love is not an easy thing to admit
[02:54.10]But I'm not ashamed of it
[03:01.19]Love is not a weakening
[03:03.69]If you feel it rushing in
[03:06.81]Don't be ashamed of it
[03:14.00]
[03:14.00]And, oh my love, I lied to you
[03:19.95]But I never needed to
[03:27.07]Oh my love, I lied to you
[03:32.99]But you always knew the truth
[03:39.92]
[03:39.92]And, oh my love, I lied to you
[03:46.08]But I never needed to
[03:52.27]Oh my love, I lied to you
[03:58.89]But you always knew the truth
