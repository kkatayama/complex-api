[00:30.67]Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
[00:34.33]It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
[00:38.23]And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
[00:42.08]Know you could get away with anything
[00:44.43]So that's exactly what you do
[00:47.70]
[00:47.70]Big man (ooh), little dignity
[00:55.42]Big man (ooh), little dignity
[01:03.04]No offense but you, you got no integrity
[01:10.77]Big man (ooh), la-la-la little dignity
[01:24.63]
[01:24.63]Well-well-well look at you
[01:26.41]Don't you clean up nice?
[01:28.54]Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
[01:32.41]Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
[01:35.91]You keep your head high
[01:38.00]Smooth operator in a shit-stained suit
[01:41.89]
[01:41.89]Big man (ooh), little dignity
[01:49.36]Big man (ooh), little dignity
[01:57.12]No offense but you, you got no integrity
[02:04.86]Big man (ooh), la-la-la little dignity
[02:14.72]Oh, I can't look away
[02:20.36]
[02:20.36]I memorized all your lies
[02:23.59]I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
[02:27.91]I fantasize your demise
[02:31.07]I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
[02:35.71]
[02:35.71]I keep thinking
[02:37.28]This time the end'll be different but it isn't
[02:42.21]I keep thinking (keep thinking)
[02:44.78]The end is gonna be different
[02:47.33]But you keep on winning
[02:51.52]
[02:51.52]Big man (ooh), little dignity
[02:59.00]Big man (ooh), little dignity
[03:06.83]No offense but you, you got no integrity
[03:14.55]Big man (ooh), la-la-la little dignity
