[00:20.74]Drain me dry
[00:23.25]Down to the last drop
[00:27.47]Pearls before swine, all flowers die
[00:31.32]Tapped the last good vein
[00:33.28]Don't know how to shut it off
[00:35.07]
[00:35.07]Yeah, once you get me going
[00:40.05]I don't know how to stop
[00:41.81]I don't know how to stop
[00:42.91]Once you get me going
[00:47.23]I don't know how to stop
[00:49.12]I don't know how to
[00:51.10]
[00:51.10]All for your sake
[00:55.51]Became the very thing that I hate
[00:58.03]I lost my way
[01:01.91]Spinning in an endless figure 8
[01:13.00]
[01:13.00]I won't miss the feeling
[01:18.39]My flimsy spine, unsuspicious mind
[01:22.70]I was only being kind
[01:24.35]But you mistook me for weak
[01:26.47]
[01:26.47]And once I get going
[01:31.43]I don't know how to stop
[01:33.14]I don't know how to stop going
[01:38.60]I don't know how to stop
[01:40.48]I don't know how to
[01:42.44]
[01:42.44]All for your sake
[01:46.81]Became the very thing that I hate
[01:49.31]I lost my way
[01:53.23]Spinning in an endless figure 8
[02:11.81]
[02:11.81]Candle light, candle light
[02:15.54]Burning 'til broad daylight
[02:19.22]Candle light, candle light
[02:22.77]Burning at both ends tonight
[02:26.35]
[02:26.35]How could I? How could I?
[02:30.10]If I'm made of thin ice
[02:34.11]How could I? How could I?
[02:37.20]You'd be wise if you thought twice
[02:42.80]
[02:42.80]All for your sake
[02:47.18]Became the very thing that I hate
[02:49.77]I lost my way
[02:53.56]Spinning in an endless figure
[02:57.36]
[02:57.36]What remains?
[03:01.85]And now I think I'm losing my shape
[03:04.47]Not a trace
[03:07.72]No end and no beginning, figure 8
