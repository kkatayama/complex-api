[00:07.17]Said I was gonna take some flowers to my neighbor
[00:10.29]But I ran out of time
[00:14.55]Didn't wanna show up to the party empty-handed
[00:17.85]But I ran out of time
[00:22.27]Said I'll walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
[00:26.77]The extra mile
[00:29.95]Thought I'd send a card with my condolences
[00:32.86]But, damn, I just ran out of time
[00:37.36]
[00:37.36]Intentions only get you so far
[00:45.20]What if I'm just a selfish prick? No regard
[00:52.40]
[00:52.40]I, I'm always running out of time
[01:02.00]I'm always running out of time
[01:07.85]
[01:07.85]Never mind, I hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
[01:11.99]But I was just so tired
[01:15.38]There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car, otherwise
[01:19.56]Would've been here on time
[01:22.95]Shoulda, coulda, wouldn't matter, ultimate alibi
[01:27.11]You know it's a lie
[01:29.46]
[01:29.46]There was a fire (metaphorically)
[01:33.31]Be there in five (hyperbolically)
[01:37.88]
[01:37.88]Intentions only get you so far (it was on my list, I swear I meant to get to it)
[01:45.78]A harsh reality to discover
[01:52.81]
[01:52.81]I, I'm always running out of time
[01:58.78]She's always running out of time
[02:02.64]I'm always running out of time
[02:23.00]
[02:23.00]Why we gotta be in a rush?
[02:25.21]My watch is just for decoration
[02:30.52]Look, I showed up early for once
[02:32.99]Now that's a new sensation
[02:40.39]
[02:40.39]We're always running out of time
[02:44.15]She's always running out of time
[02:47.84]I'm always running out of time
[02:55.37]
[02:55.37]I'm always running out of time
[02:59.32]She's always running out of time (out of time)
[03:03.00]I'm always running out of time
