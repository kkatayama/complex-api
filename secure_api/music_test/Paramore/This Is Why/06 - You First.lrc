[00:25.00]Living well is not my kind of revenge
[00:30.07]You should take it from me
[00:34.20]Living well is just a privilege
[00:37.20]Thought I'd simmer down as I got older
[00:40.36]Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder
[00:43.47]Who invited you?
[00:49.98]
[00:49.98]Just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
[00:55.07]I give it my energy and it keeps on coming back
[00:59.54]But just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
[01:04.36]I give it my energy and it keeps on coming
[01:08.49]
[01:08.49]Everyone is the bad guy
[01:12.60]And there's no way, no way to know
[01:16.46]Who's the worst
[01:21.47]But Karma's gonna come for all of us
[01:25.25]And I hope, I hope, I just hope
[01:28.70]She comes, comes for you first, oh
[01:36.71]
[01:36.71]Which wolf wins? I guess it really depends
[01:41.65]Just gotta wait and see
[01:45.65]Which one's appetite's the biggest
[01:49.02]Turns out I'm living in a horror film
[01:51.76]Where I'm both the killer and the final girl
[01:54.79]So who, who are you?
[02:01.82]
[02:01.82]Just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
[02:06.96]I give it my energy and it keeps on coming back
[02:11.24]But just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
[02:16.12]I give it my energy and it keeps on coming
[02:20.15]
[02:20.15]Everyone is the bad guy
[02:24.40]And there's no way, no way to know
[02:28.08]Who's the worst
[02:33.28]'Cause Karma's gonna come for all of us
[02:36.87]And I hope, I hope, I just hope
[02:40.18]She comes, comes for you first, oh
[02:59.36]
[02:59.36]Never said I wasn't petty
[03:05.59]Never said I wasn't petty
[03:10.44]
[03:10.44]I never said I wasn't petty
[03:12.13]You can bet I don't regret it for a second
[03:14.40]It's a pleasure, it's a reckoning
[03:16.64]Never said I wasn't petty
[03:18.30]I'll do better when you're better
[03:19.82]Let me revel in your defeat
[03:24.31]
[03:24.31]Everyone is the bad guy
[03:28.28]And there's no way, no way to know
[03:31.85]Who's the worst
[03:37.24]Karma's gonna come for all of us
[03:40.70]And I hope, I hope, I just hope
[03:44.15]She comes, comes for you first, oh
