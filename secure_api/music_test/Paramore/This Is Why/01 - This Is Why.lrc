[00:31.37]If you have an opinion
[00:35.27]Maybe you should shove it
[00:38.84]Or maybe you could scream it
[00:43.46]Might be best to keep it
[00:45.74]
[00:45.74]To yourself (to yourself)
[00:49.69]To yourself (to yourself)
[00:54.55]
[00:54.55]This is why I don't leave the house
[00:58.20]You say the coast is clear
[01:00.45]But you won't catch me out
[01:02.17]Oh, why? This is why
[01:10.18]
[01:10.18]Better have conviction
[01:13.95]'Cause we want crimes of passion
[01:17.80]Survival of the fittest
[01:21.11]You're either with us or you can keep it
[01:24.87]
[01:24.87]To yourself (to yourself)
[01:28.53]To yourself (to yourself)
[01:32.71]To yourself, yourself, yourself
[01:36.55]To yourself (to yourself)
[01:41.53]
[01:41.53]This is why I don't leave the house
[01:45.06]You say the coast is clear
[01:47.28]But you won't catch me out
[01:48.80]Oh, why? This is why
[01:57.23]
[01:57.23]This is why I don't leave the house
[02:00.60]You say the coast is clear
[02:02.82]But you won't catch me out
[02:04.55]Oh, why? This is why
[02:20.88]
[02:20.88]One step beyond your door
[02:24.13]It might as well have been a free fall
[02:28.72]One step beyond your door
[02:32.24]Falling down an endless hall
[02:36.40]One step beyond your door
[02:39.88]Might as well have been a free fall
[02:44.42]One step beyond your door
[02:47.20]And I'm floating like a cannonball
[02:51.71]
[02:51.71]This is why I don't leave the house
[02:55.19]You say the coast is clear
[02:57.40]But you won't catch me out
[02:58.92]Oh, why? This is why
[03:07.45]
[03:07.45]This is why I don't leave the house
[03:10.85]You say the coast is clear
[03:12.54]But oh no, you won't catch me out
[03:14.64]Oh, why? This is why
