[00:07.43]Now when you say you wanna slow down
[00:10.94]Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
[00:15.41]Maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
[00:19.26]On our romance
[00:23.48]
[00:23.48]What do you mean I got it backwards?
[00:27.14]You know we're gonna be forever
[00:30.98]Why are you telling me goodbye?
[00:34.06]Aren't you gonna stay the night?
[00:36.46]
[00:36.46]Are we really over now?
[00:41.09]Maybe I can change your mind
[00:45.45]Soon as you walk out my door
[00:49.63]I'm gonna call a hundred times
[00:54.80]
[00:54.80]Now I walk under a pink sky
[01:00.87]Lovers for long and pass me by
[01:04.43]I poured my heart out to your voice mail
[01:06.98]Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town
[01:11.84]
[01:11.84]And now I'm standing at your doorstep
[01:15.60]With Los Angeles behind me dear
[01:20.15]If you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied
[01:24.16]'Cause I really need to see you
[01:27.88]
[01:27.88]You're not here when I break in
[01:29.70]I'm gonna go into your closet
[01:31.48]Just so I can smell your skin
[01:33.69]As the chemicals swim
[01:37.25]I know I'll never love again
[01:39.09]I swear I'll never love again
[01:43.74]
[01:43.74]Baby, are we really over now?
[01:47.01]Maybe I can change your mind
[01:50.73]Soon as you walk out my door
[01:54.76]I'm gonna call a hundred times
[02:14.71]
[02:14.71]I'm not one of those crazy girls
[02:18.88]I'm not one of those crazy girls
[02:22.73]I'm not one of those crazy girls
[02:26.67]I'm not one of those crazy girls
[02:30.88]
