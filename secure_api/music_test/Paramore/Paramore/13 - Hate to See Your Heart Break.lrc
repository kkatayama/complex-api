[00:00.72]There is not a single word, in the whole world
[00:12.55]That could describe the hurt the dullest knife just sawing and back and forth
[00:23.35]And ripping through the softest skin there ever was
[00:28.41]
[00:28.41]How were you to know?
[00:32.02]Well, how were you to know?
[00:37.20]
[00:37.20]And I, I hate to see your heart break
[00:45.25]I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
[00:51.53]But I've been there before
[00:56.60]And I, I hate to see your heart break
[01:03.82]I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
[01:10.51]But I've been there before
[01:15.54]
[01:15.54]Love, happens all the time, to people who aren't kind
[01:26.78]And heroes who are blind,
[01:32.40]Expecting perfect script in movie scenes
[01:37.51]Once an awkward silence mystery
[01:42.93]
[01:42.93]How were you to know?
[01:46.94]Well how were you to know, oh, oh?
[01:52.43]
[01:52.43]And I, I hate to see your heart break
[01:59.63]I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
[02:06.36]But I've been there before
[02:11.18]And I, I hate to see your heart break
[02:18.68]I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
[02:24.91]But I've been there before
[02:30.16]
[02:30.16]For all the air that's in your lungs
[02:38.92]For all the joy that is to come
[02:47.61]For all the things that you're alive to feel
[02:51.80]Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal
[02:56.63]
[02:56.63]Well, how were you to know?
[03:01.28]Well, how were you to know?
[03:07.14]
[03:07.14]And I, I hate to see your heart break
[03:14.96]I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
[03:21.16]But I've been there before
[03:25.85]And I, I hate to see your heart break
[03:32.19]I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
[03:39.25]But I've been there before
