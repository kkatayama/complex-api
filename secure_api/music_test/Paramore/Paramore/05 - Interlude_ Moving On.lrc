[00:02.05]Let 'em have their time
[00:05.55]Sit back and let 'em shine
[00:08.33]Let 'em rise and rise
[00:10.40]'Cause one day they're gonna fall
[00:13.10]
[00:13.10]Let 'em soak in the sun
[00:15.40]Sit back and let 'em have their fun
[00:17.95]Let 'em spill their guts
[00:20.14]'Cause one day they're gonna slip on 'em
[00:22.89]
[00:22.89]Well, I could be angry but you're not worth a fight
[00:28.77]And besides, I'm moving on
[00:32.93]I've counted to ten and I'm feeling alright
[00:38.46]And besides, I'm moving on
[00:42.87]
[00:42.87]Let 'em play their songs
[00:45.05]Let 'em say what's right and wrong
[00:47.55]Let 'em do their thing
[00:49.41]'Cause it'll never be you and me
[00:52.48]
[00:52.48]We got our own style
[00:54.70]We got a way of living life
[00:57.37]If they can't get down
[00:59.35]Well, we don't need them around
[01:02.26]
[01:02.26]Well, I could be angry but you're not worth a fight
[01:07.74]And besides, I'm moving on
[01:12.22]I've counted to ten and I'm feeling alright
[01:17.33]And besides, I'm moving
