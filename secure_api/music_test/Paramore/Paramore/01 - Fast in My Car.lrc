[00:30.65]Been through the ringer a couple times
[00:35.64]I came out callous and cruel
[00:39.18]And my two friends know this very well
[00:42.21]Because they went through it too
[00:46.24]
[00:46.24]The three of us were initiates
[00:50.60]We had to learn how to deal
[00:54.44]And when we spotted a second chance
[00:58.06]We had to learn how to steal
[01:00.34]
[01:00.34]Hollowed out and
[01:02.39]Filled up with hate
[01:03.81]All we want is
[01:05.84]You to give us a break
[01:07.66]
[01:07.66]We're driving fast in my car
[01:11.27]We've got our riot gear on
[01:13.24]But we just want to have fun
[01:14.82]No, we're not looking for violence
[01:17.57]Tonight we want to have fun
[01:27.81]
[01:27.81]No one's the same as they used to be
[01:31.22]Much as we try to pretend
[01:34.62]No one's as innocent as could be
[01:38.65]We all fall short, we all sin
[01:42.19]
[01:42.19]But now we are looking backward
[01:46.77]We won't try raising the dead
[01:49.91]We only see what's in front of us
[01:54.04]We only see straight ahead
[01:56.41]
[01:56.41]Hollowed out and
[01:58.34]Filled up with hate
[02:00.29]All we want is
[02:02.25]You to give us a break
[02:04.02]
[02:04.02]We're driving fast in my car
[02:07.13]We've got our riot gear on
[02:09.93]But we just want to have fun
[02:11.36]No, we're not looking for violence
[02:13.75]Tonight we want to have fun
[02:49.13]
[02:49.13]Get in my car and we'll drive around
[02:53.93]And make believe we are free
[02:57.66]Already proved we can tough it up
[03:01.27]And we get along so smoothly
[03:03.29]
[03:03.29]We're driving fast in my car
[03:07.05]We've got our riot gear on
[03:09.50]But we just want to have fun
[03:11.49]No, we're not looking for violence
[03:15.11]Tonight we want to have fun
[03:18.76]
[03:18.76]We're driving fast in my car
[03:21.46]We're driving fast in my car
[03:26.09]No, we're not looking for violence
[03:29.95]We're driving fast in my car
[03:32.76]And we just want to have fun
