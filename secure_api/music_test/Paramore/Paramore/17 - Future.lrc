[00:19.38]I'm writing the future
[00:22.47]I'm writing it out, loud.
[00:27.21]We don't talk about the past
[00:31.50]We don't talk about the past, now
[00:37.72]
[00:37.72]So I'm writing the future
[00:40.72]I'm leaving a key here
[00:45.81]Something won't always be missing
[00:50.09]It won't always feel empty, here
[01:33.35]
[01:33.35]Just think of the future
[01:37.37]And think of your dreams
[01:42.51]You'll get away from here
[01:46.56]You'll get away eventually
[01:52.72]
[01:52.72]So just think of your future
[01:56.29]Think of a new life
[02:01.47]Don't get lost in the memories
[02:04.88]Keep your eyes on a new prize
