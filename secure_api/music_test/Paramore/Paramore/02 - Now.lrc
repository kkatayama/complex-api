[00:01.61]Don't try to take this from me
[00:03.20]Don't try to take this from me, now
[00:07.42]
[00:07.42]Don't try to take this from me
[00:08.95]Don't try to take this from me, now
[00:13.12]
[00:13.12]Feels like I'm waking from the dead
[00:15.16]And everyone's been waitin' on me
[00:17.70]Least now I'll never have to wonder
[00:21.43]What it's like to sleep a year away
[00:23.91]But were we indestructible
[00:26.68]I thought that we could brave it all
[00:30.11]I never thought that what would take me out
[00:34.03]Was hiding down below
[00:36.54]
[00:36.54]Lost the battle, win the war
[00:41.37]Bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
[00:47.12]We're starting over, or head back in
[00:52.94]There's a time and a place to die but this ain't it
[00:58.81]
[00:58.81]If there's a future, we want it, now
[01:06.38]If there's a future, we want it, now
[01:12.26]If there's a future, we want it, now
[01:18.11]If there's a future, we want it, now
[01:23.77]
[01:23.77]Don't try to take this from me
[01:25.78]Don't try to take this from me, now
[01:30.17]
[01:30.17]Don't try to take this from me
[01:31.89]Don't try to take this from me, now
[01:36.13]
[01:36.13]Wish I could find a crystal ball
[01:37.89]For the days I feel completely worthless
[01:42.11]You know I'd use it all for good
[01:43.91]I would not take it for granted
[01:47.67]Instead, I'd have some memories
[01:49.73]For the days I don't feel anything
[01:53.63]At least, they would remind me
[01:55.65]Not to make the same mistakes again
[01:59.14]
[01:59.14]Lost the battle, win the war
[02:04.25]I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
[02:09.95]We're starting over or head back in
[02:15.79]There's a time and a place to die but this ain't it
[02:21.78]
[02:21.78]If there's a future, we want it, now
[02:29.29]If there's a future, we want it, now
[02:35.45]If there's a future, we want it, now
[02:41.19]If there's a future, we want it, now
[02:52.78]
[02:52.78]There's a time and a place to die
[02:55.56]
[02:55.56]There's a time and a place to die
[03:01.37]And this ain't it
[03:04.52]
[03:04.52]There's a time and a place to die
[03:08.11]And this ain't it, this ain't it
[03:14.91]This ain't it
[03:21.89]
[03:21.89]There's a time and a place to die
[03:24.51]There's a time and a place to die
[03:27.71]But this ain't it, no
[03:33.99]
[03:33.99]If there's a future, we want it, now
[03:40.50]If there's a future, we want it, now
[03:46.43]If there's a future, we want it, now
[03:51.84]
[03:51.84]If there's a future, we want it, now
[03:58.17]Now, now
