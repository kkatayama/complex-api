[00:01.08]I don't even know myself at all
[00:03.25]I thought I would be happy but now
[00:08.82]The more I try to push it I realize gonna let go of control
[00:17.27]
[00:17.27]Gonna let it happen, gonna let it happen,
[00:26.01]Gonna let it happen, just let it happen
[00:37.04]
[00:37.04]It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
[00:46.10]And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
[00:55.84]
[00:55.84]Every night I try my best to dream tomorrow makes it better
[01:23.82]And wake up to the cold reality and not a thing is changed
[01:33.28]But it would be happen, gonna let it happen
[01:42.70]Gonna let it happen, gonna let it happen
[01:52.51]
[01:52.51]It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
[02:01.19]And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
[02:11.13]It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
[02:20.54]And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
[02:30.43]
[02:30.43]And the salt in my wounds isn't burning anymore than it used to
[02:38.37]It's not that I don't feel the pain it's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
[02:47.01]And the blood of these veins isn't pumping any less than it ever has
[02:56.52]And that's the hope I have the only thing I know that's keeping me alive
[03:07.46]Alive
[03:13.19]
[03:13.19]Gonna let it happen, gonna let it happen
[03:22.13]Gonna let it happen, gonna let it happen
[03:31.61]Gonna let it happen, gonna let it happen
[03:40.97]Gonna let it happen, gonna let it happen
[03:50.40]
[03:50.40]It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
[03:59.44]And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
[04:08.93]It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
[04:18.17]And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
