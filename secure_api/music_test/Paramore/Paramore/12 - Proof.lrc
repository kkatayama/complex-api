[00:03.47]It's really hard
[00:05.69]I can't cry in your arms
[00:07.80]'Cause you're not here
[00:10.11]It's not your fault
[00:11.28]And if it was I wouldn't care
[00:14.60]
[00:14.60]My heart is bigger
[00:16.04]Than the distance in-between us
[00:18.91]I know it 'cause I feel it beating
[00:23.74]
[00:23.74]So strong it'll knock you down
[00:26.75]So strong, so strong
[00:29.98]
[00:29.98]Over here
[00:32.37]I can't count the miles away
[00:33.94]From where I wanna be
[00:36.71]I bet your skin is warm
[00:38.55]And that you're smiling
[00:41.28]
[00:41.28]Yeah, that's what I always
[00:43.34]Loved the most about you
[00:46.18]You're so strong
[00:47.03]Come and knock me down, hey
[00:48.86]
[00:48.86]Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
[00:52.01](Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
[00:54.51]Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
[00:57.06]Then I'll believe in what you say
[00:59.23]There's nothing left for you to do
[01:01.61]The only proof that I need is you
[01:08.02]
[01:08.02]I'll get in my car
[01:10.22]Drive it faster than I ever did before
[01:14.59]Head out west until I finally reach the shore
[01:18.81]
[01:18.81]And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
[01:23.32]And we'll ride the undercurrent
[01:25.56]Down to the floor
[01:28.26]
[01:28.26]Making friends with all
[01:29.80]The unfamiliar creatures
[01:32.49]And pushing back
[01:33.65]All the unnecessary pressure
[01:36.79]Come up for air just so you
[01:38.86]Know we won't drown
[01:40.11]
[01:40.11]You're so strong
[01:41.80]The world can't keep us down, hey
[01:44.29]
[01:44.29]Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
[01:48.01](Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
[01:50.06]Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
[01:52.39]Then I'll believe in what you say
[01:54.40]There's nothing left for you to do
[01:56.81]The only proof that I need is you
[02:01.00]
[02:01.00]Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
[02:09.08]Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
[02:16.76]
[02:16.76]So do you love me? (Yeah)
[02:19.45]All you gotta do is say yes
[02:21.41]Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
[02:24.00]And I won't ever second guess
[02:25.70]
[02:25.70]Now do you love me? (Yeah)
[02:28.13]All you gotta do is say yes
[02:30.08]Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
[02:33.16]Then you already proved it
[02:34.96]
[02:34.96]Yeah, yeah, hey
[02:37.89]
[02:37.89]Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
[02:41.24](Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
[02:43.50]Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
[02:46.00]Then I'll believe in what you say
[02:47.92]There's nothing left for you to do
[02:50.29]The only proof that I need is
[02:53.29]
[02:53.29]Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
[02:56.03](Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
[02:58.52]Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
[03:01.03]Then I'll believe in what you say
[03:02.95]There's nothing left for you to do
[03:05.47]The only proof that I need is you
