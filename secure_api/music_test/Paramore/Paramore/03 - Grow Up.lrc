[00:04.74]I told 'em all where to stick it
[00:06.80]I left town with a dime to my name
[00:09.41]I said, I'm done with all of my fake friends
[00:11.75]Self-righteous pawns in a losing game
[00:14.70]
[00:14.70]Got my band and a light that won't go out
[00:17.34]Been burning since the day I was born
[00:19.98]So I cry just a little then I'll dry my eyes
[00:22.73]'Cause I'm not a little girl no more
[00:25.31]
[00:25.31]Some of us have to grow up sometimes
[00:29.08]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
[00:35.38]Some of us have to grow up sometimes
[00:39.53]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
[00:47.98]
[00:47.98]Stood in line for so long just to picket
[00:50.96]Something I will never understand
[00:53.44]Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
[00:56.14]Won't you just admit you don't care?
[00:58.89]
[00:58.89]And lady, I don't want your pity
[01:01.08]So don't feel sad for me
[01:03.71]I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
[01:06.42]Maybe we're both just living out our dream
[01:09.19]
[01:09.19]And some of us have to grow up sometimes
[01:12.81]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
[01:19.46]Some of us have to grow up sometimes
[01:22.96]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
[01:29.07]
[01:29.07]We get along for the most part
[01:34.23]Me and reality, the light and the dark
[01:39.23]We live alone, two different worlds
[01:44.28]Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
[01:49.00]But we get along
[01:50.75]
[01:50.75]We get along
[01:54.53](For the most part)
[01:56.25]We get along
[01:59.51](Yeah, for the most part)
[02:01.06]We get along
[02:04.80](For the most part)
[02:06.38]We get along
[02:11.30]
[02:11.30]We get along
[02:16.32]We get along
[02:21.14]
[02:21.14]Some of us have to grow up sometimes
[02:24.49]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)
[02:31.37]Some of us have to grow up sometimes
[02:34.81]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)
[02:41.69]
[02:41.69]Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up, never grow old)
[02:45.03]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
[02:51.93]Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up, never grow old)
[02:55.68]And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
