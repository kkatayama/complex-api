[00:02.14]I'm not angry anymore
[00:04.11]Well, sometimes I am
[00:06.39]I don't think badly of you
[00:08.57]Well, sometimes I do
[00:14.05]
[00:14.05]It depends on the day
[00:16.28]The extend of all my worthless rage
[00:18.46]I'm not angry anymore
[00:22.93]
[00:22.93]I'm not bitter anymore
[00:25.59]I'm syrupy sweet
[00:27.55]I rot your teeth down to the core
[00:30.02]If I'm really happy
[00:34.38]
[00:34.38]It depends on the day
[00:37.51]If I wake up in a giddy haze
[00:39.76]Well I'm not angry
[00:42.28]I'm not totally angry
[00:44.28]I'm not all that angry anymore
