[00:23.98]What a shame, what a shame we all remain
[00:27.93]Such fragile, broken things
[00:30.73]A beauty half-betrayed, butterflies with punctured wings
[00:36.02]Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
[00:42.48]What once was blazing light now there's a tiny spark
[00:48.13]
[00:48.13]Oh glory, come and find me
[00:54.34]Oh glory, come and find me
[01:00.17]
[01:00.17]Dancing all alone
[01:04.00]To the sound of an enemy's song
[01:06.60]I'll be lost until you find me
[01:12.28]Fighting on my own
[01:16.37]In a war that's already been won
[01:18.71]I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh glory
[01:28.82]Here
[01:36.80]
[01:36.80]What a mess, what a mystery we've made
[01:39.68]Of love and other simple things
[01:42.74]Learning to forgive
[01:46.21]Even when it wasn't our mistake
[01:48.99]I question every human, who won't look in my eyes
[01:54.63]Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind
[02:00.11]
[02:00.11]Oh glory, you will find me
[02:06.57]
[02:06.57]Dancing all alone
[02:10.45]To the sound of an enemy's song
[02:12.93]I'll be lost until you find me
[02:18.48]Fighting on my own
[02:22.57]In a war that's already been won
[02:25.29]I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh glory
[04:06.22]
[04:06.22]Like the moon, we borrow our light
[04:11.47]I am nothing but a shadow in the night
[04:18.13]So if you let me, I will catch fire
[04:24.00]To let your glory and mercy shine
