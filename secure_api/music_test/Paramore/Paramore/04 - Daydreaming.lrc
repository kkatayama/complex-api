[00:25.44]Living in a city of sleepless people
[00:31.70]Who all know the limits and won't go too far outside the lines
[00:43.13]'Cause they're out of their minds
[00:50.05]I wanna get out and build my own home
[00:56.88]On a street where reality is not much different from dreams I've had
[01:09.13]A dream is all I have
[01:15.94]
[01:15.94]Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
[01:21.89]Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
[01:27.91]Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
[01:34.82]Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
[01:40.19]And I'm alright
[01:48.53]
[01:48.53]Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
[01:55.89]Hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
[02:01.06]We wait for the bell
[02:05.71]And we dream of somewhere else
[02:12.64]
[02:12.64]Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
[02:19.83]Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
[02:25.18]Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
[02:32.72]Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
[02:37.92]And I'm alright
[02:40.55]
[02:40.55]It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
[02:45.57]Just don't wanna be here no more
[02:51.78]It's not enough (we're only half alive)
[02:58.06]I'm gonna go (we're only half alive)
[03:03.96]Where the rest of the dreamers go
[03:09.23]Where the dreamers go
[03:34.07]
[03:34.07]Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
[03:40.47]Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
[03:44.97]And I'm alright
[03:46.94]Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
[03:53.31]Daydreamer, we used to be half alive
[03:57.85]Now I'm alright
[04:01.69]I'm alright, I'm alright
