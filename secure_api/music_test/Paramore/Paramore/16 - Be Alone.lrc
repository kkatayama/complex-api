[00:05.69]So what if I don't have a lot to talk about?
[00:17.07]I shove my mouth and keep it locked until it comes
[00:23.22]And what if I don't ever want to leave my house?
[00:29.27]Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out
[00:35.49]
[00:35.49]Alone
[00:39.04]You should be alone
[00:44.22]Yeah, you should be alone

[01:14.03]But you want time then let it ride inside in silence too
[01:20.10]See I ain't want to climb some social ladder too
[01:26.08]Some Shanghai-La's that all the cool kids will abuse
