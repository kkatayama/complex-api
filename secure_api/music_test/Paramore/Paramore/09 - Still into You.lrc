[00:11.76]Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
[00:17.01]I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better
[00:25.88]It's not a walk in the park to love each other
[00:31.14]But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny, you're worth it
[00:38.24]
[00:38.24]'Cause after all this time
[00:41.26]I'm still into you
[00:45.26]
[00:45.26]I should be over all the butterflies
[00:49.17]But I'm into you (I'm into you)
[00:52.33]And baby, even on our worst nights
[00:56.21]I'm into you (I'm into you)
[00:59.61]Let 'em wonder how we got this far
[01:02.90]'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
[01:06.46]Yeah, after all this time
[01:09.52]I'm still into you
[01:18.80]
[01:18.80]Recount the night that I first met your mother
[01:24.12]And on the drive back to my house I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
[01:32.90]You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
[01:38.64]And to your favorite song, we sang along, to the start of forever
[01:45.27]
[01:45.27]And after all this time
[01:48.31]I'm still into you
[01:52.30]
[01:52.30]I should be over all the butterflies
[01:56.17]But I'm into you (I'm into you)
[01:59.35]And baby, even on our worst nights
[02:03.27]I'm into you (I'm into you)
[02:06.68]Let 'em wonder how we got this far
[02:09.98]'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
[02:13.53]Yeah, after all this time
[02:16.61]I'm still into you
[02:33.14]
[02:33.14]Some things just, some things just make sense
[02:36.00]And one of those is you and I
[02:40.23]Some things just, some things just make sense
[02:43.09]And even after all this time
[02:49.25]
[02:49.25]I'm into you
[02:52.39]Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you
[02:59.40]
[02:59.40]I should be over all the butterflies
[03:03.29]But I'm into you (I'm into you)
[03:06.43]And baby, even on our worst nights
[03:10.42]I'm into you (I'm into you)
[03:13.75]Let 'em wonder how we got this far
[03:17.08]'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
[03:20.59]Yeah, after all this time
[03:23.61]I'm still into you
[03:26.49]
[03:26.49]I'm still into you
[03:30.05]I'm still into you
