[00:29.18]Why do you care what people think?
[00:31.80]Are you hooked up to their leash?
[00:33.82]You know anklebiters
[00:35.49]Ate up your personality
[00:37.45]
[00:37.45]Try to remember how it felt
[00:40.16]To just make up your own steps
[00:42.19]And let anklebiters
[00:43.81]Chew up, spit out someone else
[00:46.40]
[00:46.40]And fall in love with yourself
[00:49.24]
[00:49.24]Because someday you're gonna be
[00:51.34]The only one you've got
[00:53.55]Someday you're gonna be
[00:55.45]The only one you've got
[00:58.35]
[00:58.35]Why you wanna please the world
[00:59.18]And leave yourself to drop dead?
[01:02.00]Someday you're gonna be
[01:03.81]The only one you've got
[01:14.57]
[01:14.57]What do you actually expect?
[01:17.16]A broken mirror to reflect?
[01:19.24]You know, anklebiters
[01:21.04]Gave you a false perception
[01:22.98]
[01:22.98]And why do I defend (c'mon, c'mon)
[01:25.95]Your ignorance?
[01:27.07]Oh, why do I defend (c'mon, c'mon)
[01:30.09]The state you're in?
[01:31.00]
[01:31.00]You should fall in love with yourself
[01:34.22]Oh, again
[01:36.20]Fall in love with yourself
[01:38.56]
[01:38.56]Because someday you're gonna be
[01:40.94]The only one you've got
[01:43.19]Someday you're gonna be
[01:44.99]The only one you've got
[01:47.72]
[01:47.72]Why you wanna please the world
[01:49.55]And leave yourself to drop dead?
[01:52.26]Someday you're gonna be
[01:54.07]The only one you've got
[01:59.20]
[01:59.20]Anklebiters
[02:03.59]Anklebiters
[02:04.82]Someday you're gonna be alone
[02:07.71]Anklebiters
[02:12.12]Anklebiters
