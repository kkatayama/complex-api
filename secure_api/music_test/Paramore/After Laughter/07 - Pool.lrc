[00:40.75]As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
[00:45.40]I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
[00:49.70]Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch
[00:53.75]Why get used to something new?
[00:55.79]'Cause no one breaks my heart like you
[00:59.48]
[00:59.48]When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
[01:03.34]For a moment, I can forget what happens in my head
[01:07.41]If I doubt you, would you come through?
[01:09.34]Happy second chance or happy ending
[01:13.30]But this time you don't leave me sinking
[01:15.53]
[01:15.53]I'm underwater
[01:18.03]No air in my lungs
[01:19.84]My eyes are open
[01:21.87]I'm done giving up
[01:23.97]You are the wave
[01:26.45]I could never tame
[01:28.05]If I survive
[01:30.45]I'll dive back in
[01:35.49]
[01:35.49]As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
[01:39.68]I went further out to see what else was left of us
[01:43.73]Never found the deep end of our little ocean
[01:47.65]Drain the fantasy of you
[01:49.88]Headfirst into shallow pools
[01:53.75]
[01:53.75]And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
[01:57.33]The illusion, can shatter before we begin
[02:01.79]If you're really sorry
[02:04.19]Happy second chance, I think I could forgive
[02:07.92]This time you won't leave me sinking
[02:09.81]
[02:09.81]I'm underwater
[02:12.42]No air in my lungs
[02:14.21]My eyes are open
[02:16.47]I'm done giving up
[02:18.47]You are the wave
[02:20.90]I could never tame
[02:22.29]If I survive
[02:24.41]I'll dive back in
[02:30.12]
[02:30.12]Dive back into
[02:32.33]Right back into
[02:34.13]Dive right back into you
[02:37.92]Now I know you
[02:38.97]Now I know you
[02:40.59]Now that I know you
[02:42.67]Dive right back into you
[02:47.10]Dive back into
[02:49.65]Right back into you
[02:50.99]Dive right back into you
[02:54.28]Now I know you
[02:55.58]Now I know you
[02:57.02]Now that I know you
[02:59.80]Dive right back into you
[03:08.33]
[03:08.33]I'm underwater
[03:09.92]No air in my lungs
[03:12.32]My eyes are open
[03:14.78]I'm done giving up
[03:16.79]You are the wave
[03:19.67]I could never tame
[03:20.87]If I survive
[03:23.21]I'll dive back in
[03:25.46]
[03:25.46]I'm underwater
[03:27.38]No air in my lungs
[03:29.13]My eyes are open
[03:31.62]I'm done giving up
[03:33.36]You are the wave
[03:36.08]I could never tame
[03:37.31]If I survive
[03:39.87]I'll dive back in
[03:42.20]I'll dive back in
[03:43.82]I'll dive back
