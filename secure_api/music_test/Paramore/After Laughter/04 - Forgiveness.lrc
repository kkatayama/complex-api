[00:20.60]You hurt me bad this time, no coming back
[00:29.03]And I cry 'til I couldn't cry, another heart attack
[00:34.03]If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
[00:37.77]And I don't pick up when you call
[00:40.30]'Cause your voice is a gun
[00:45.50]Every word is a bullet hole
[00:49.04]Shot a hole in the sun
[00:51.68]If I never look up maybe I'll never notice
[00:54.44]
[00:54.44]And you, you want forgiveness
[01:02.75]But I, I just can't do it yet
[01:11.46]
[01:11.46]There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
[01:19.82]And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
[01:26.00]If I follow it down would we just be alright?
[01:28.97]But it could take me all your life to learn to love
[01:37.44]How I thought I could love someone
[01:40.43]I haven't even begun
[01:43.00]If it's all up to us we might as well give up
[01:46.22]
[01:46.22]And you, you want forgiveness
[01:50.87](I can barely hang on to myself)
[01:54.79]But I, I can't give you that
[02:00.05](I can't give you, I can't give you that)
[02:03.27]And you, you want forgiveness
[02:08.41](I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
[02:12.02]But I, I just can't do it yet
[02:16.61](I can't do, I just can't do it yet)
[02:29.44]
[02:29.44]Don't you go and get it twisted
[02:36.06]Forgiving is not forgetting
[02:43.00]Don't you go and get it twisted
[02:48.43]Forgiving is not forgetting
[02:52.85]No, it's not forgetting
[02:54.36]No, I'll never forget it, no
[02:56.73]
[02:56.73]And you, you want forgiveness
[03:01.31](I can barely hang on to myself)
[03:05.24]But I, I can't give you that
[03:10.78](I can't give you, I can't give you that)
[03:13.62]And you, you want forgiveness
[03:18.86](I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
[03:22.31]But I, I just can't do it yet
[03:27.39](I can't do, I just can't do it yet)
