[00:18.37]Strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off
[00:24.18]I know you're shaking my hand like it is the first time
[00:29.02]Are we alright?
[00:30.42]Are you recounting all my faults?
[00:33.02]And are you racking your brain just to find them all?
[00:36.54]Could it be that I've changed? Or did you?
[00:42.77]
[00:42.77]Stop asking why
[00:45.59]Why we had to waste so much time
[00:48.37]Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
[00:52.01]'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
[00:55.80]
[00:55.80]Time is a bastard I won't break my neck to get around it
[01:00.91]But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
[01:04.50]And let the years go by without us?
[01:07.68]'Cause now I feel you by my side
[01:09.91]And I don't even care if it's been a while
[01:13.70]I can feel that we've changed and we're better this way
[01:20.10]
[01:20.10]Stop asking why
[01:22.70]Why we had to waste so much time
[01:25.51]Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
[01:29.16]'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
[01:33.22]
[01:33.22]And if you wanna call me up or come over
[01:36.17]Come on, we'll laugh 'til we cry
[01:39.01]Like we did when we were kids
[01:41.74]'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
[01:45.79]
[01:45.79]Why did it take so long?
[01:50.40]Why did it take so long?
[01:57.15]Why did it take us so long to just let go?
[02:04.15]Why did it take us so long? Stop holding on
[02:12.44]
[02:12.44]Stop asking why
[02:15.07]Why we had to waste so much time
[02:18.14]Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
[02:21.75]'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
[02:25.60]
[02:25.60]And if you wanna call me up or come over
[02:29.09]Come on we'll laugh 'til we cry
[02:31.83]Like we did when we were kids
[02:34.58]'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
[02:46.59]We can't keep keep holding on to grudges
[02:49.81]
[02:49.81]Could it be that I've changed?
[02:52.62]Could it be that I've changed?
[02:55.58]Could it be that I've changed?
[02:58.32]Could it be that I've changed? Or did you?
