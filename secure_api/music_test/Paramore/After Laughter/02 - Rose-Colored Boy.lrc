[00:17.94]Rose-colored boy
[00:19.94]I hear you making all that noise
[00:21.90]About the world you want to see
[00:24.99]And oh, I'm so annoyed
[00:28.28]'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me, ooh
[00:34.92]
[00:34.92]But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
[00:39.14]And I have taken my glasses off
[00:43.28]You got me nervous
[00:45.35]I'm right at the end of my rope
[00:47.47]A half-empty girl
[00:49.17]Don't make me laugh, I'll choke
[00:54.11]
[00:54.11]Just let me cry a little bit longer
[00:58.41]I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
[01:02.47]Hey man, we all can't be like you
[01:06.62]I wish we were all rose-colored too
[01:10.08]My rose-colored boy
[01:15.68]
[01:15.68]Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
[01:21.11]
[01:21.11]I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause
[01:27.24]'Cause I've been through a lot
[01:29.39]Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
[01:33.64]If it's alright by you
[01:37.58]
[01:37.58]But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
[01:41.94]And I have taken my glasses off
[01:45.90]You got me nervous
[01:47.81]And you're turning it into a joke
[01:50.03]A half-empty girl
[01:51.74]Don't make me laugh, I'll
[01:54.66]
[01:54.66]Just let me cry a little bit longer
[01:58.93]I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
[02:03.03]Hey, man, we all can't be like you
[02:07.33]I wish we were all rose-colored too
[02:10.55]My rose-colored boy
[02:15.72]
[02:15.72]Mhm-mmh, ooh
[02:21.41]
[02:21.41]Leave me here a little bit longer
[02:23.42]I think I wanna stay in the car
[02:25.23]I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
[02:29.82]You say, "We gotta look on the bright side"
[02:31.54]I say, "Well maybe if you wanna go blind"
[02:33.74]You say my eyes are getting too dark now
[02:35.59]But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind
[02:38.37]
[02:38.37]Just let me cry a little bit longer
[02:42.71]I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
[02:46.86]Hey, man, we all can't be like you
[02:50.95]I wish we were all rose-colored too
[02:54.33]My rose-colored

[02:55.21]Just let me cry (cry) a little bit longer
[02:59.32]I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
[03:03.64]I know we all can't be like you
[03:07.65]I wish we were all rose-colored too
[03:11.05]My rose-colored boy
[03:16.69]
[03:16.69]Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
