[00:11.00]Man, you really know how to get someone down
[00:21.72]Everything was fine, until you came around
[00:31.09]And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
[00:36.48]After all, wasn't I the one who said
[00:42.29]To keep your feet on the ground?
[00:47.76]Man, you really brought me back down
[00:51.77]
[00:51.77]Hold onto hope if you got it
[00:56.96]Don't let it go for nobody
[01:02.42]And they say that dreaming is free
[01:07.71]But I wouldn't care what it cost me
[01:12.38]
[01:12.38]You got me tied up but I stay close to the window
[01:23.15]And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
[01:32.53]I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
[01:37.63]And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
[01:44.38]When you gonna hear me out?
[01:49.14]Man, you really bring me down
[01:53.08]
[01:53.08]Hold onto hope if you got it
[01:58.32]Don't let it go for nobody
[02:03.43]They say that dreaming is free
[02:09.04]But I wouldn't care what it cost me
[02:16.31]
[02:16.31]Reality will break your heart
[02:21.42]Survival will not be the hardest part
[02:26.70]It's keeping all your hopes alive
[02:30.06]When all the rest of you has died
[02:35.64]So let it break your heart
[02:39.64]
[02:39.64]And hold onto hope if you got it
[02:44.92]Don't let it go for nobody
[02:50.33]Hold onto hope if you got it
[02:55.74]Don't let it go for nobody
[03:00.92]They say that dreaming is free
[03:06.37]But I wouldn't care what it cost me
