[00:15.33]These old letters from years ago
[00:18.56]I felt it was leading to a continued
[00:36.14]
[00:36.14]When I wrote this letter I felt
[00:36.97]I may have been finally able to address how it feels
[00:38.96]
[00:38.96]Another brick-red room, another black-top town
[00:44.04]Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
[00:48.22]Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
[00:51.84]Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
[00:56.04]
[00:56.04]Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
[00:59.82]Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
[01:03.46]More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
[01:07.24]To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot dance
[01:11.91]
[01:11.91]Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
[01:15.69]In scares of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
[01:19.61]So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
[01:23.12]As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
[01:27.46]
[01:27.46]When this repetition ends behind the window shades
[01:31.35]A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
[01:35.15]That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
[01:39.33]And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again
[01:43.42]
[01:43.42]I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
[01:46.79]And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
[01:51.51]Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
[01:54.88]I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
[01:58.80]
[01:58.80]So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
[02:03.37]My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
[02:07.09]You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
[02:10.76]I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
[02:14.94]
[02:14.94]You're no friend of mine
[02:16.67]You're no friend of mine
[02:19.27]I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
[02:22.73]You see a flood-lit form
[02:24.58]I see a shirt design
[02:26.80]I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
[02:30.77]
[02:30.77]I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
[02:33.96]Realising what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
[02:40.90]And I hate I might actually be more afraid to let myself down
[02:46.44]I feel like they know the story
[02:48.66]I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
[02:52.20]Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
[02:54.98]Jump in and grab the coat
[02:57.05]And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
[02:59.97]And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
[03:06.39]I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
[03:10.77]In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
[03:15.47]If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful
