[00:26.50]I can't call you a stranger
[00:30.52]But I can't call you
[00:35.17]I know you think that I erased you
[00:39.37]You may hate me but I can't hate you
[00:43.13]And I won't replace you
[00:45.25]
[00:45.25]Tell me how to feel about you now
[00:49.55]Tell me how to feel about you now
[00:53.11]Oh, let me know
[00:56.76]Do I suffocate or let go?
[01:03.20]
[01:03.20]I think I'm tired of getting over it
[01:07.70]Just starting something new again
[01:12.17]I'm getting sick of the beginnings
[01:16.23]And always coming to your defenses
[01:20.74]I guess it's good to get it off my chest
[01:25.00]I guess I can't believe I haven't yet
[01:29.06]You know I got my own convictions
[01:33.48]And they're stronger than any addiction
[01:37.05]But no one's winning
[01:39.24]
[01:39.24]Tell me how to feel about you now
[01:43.52]Tell me how to feel about you now
[01:46.95]Oh, let me know
[01:51.16]Do I suffocate or let go?
[01:56.51]Tell me how to feel about you now
[02:00.74]Tell me how to feel about you now
[02:04.33]Oh, let me know
[02:08.56]Do I suffocate or let go?
[02:29.96]
[02:29.96]You keep me up with your silence
[02:34.27]Take me down with your quiet
[02:38.54]Of all the weapons you fight with
[02:42.71]Your silence is the most violent
[02:48.22]
[02:48.22]Tell me how to feel about you now
[02:52.90]Tell me how to feel about you now
[02:56.02]Oh, let me know
[03:00.16]Do I suffocate or let go?
[03:05.53]Tell me how to feel about you now
[03:09.93]Tell me how to feel about you now
[03:13.50]Oh, let me know
[03:17.50]Do I suffocate or let go?
[03:39.57]
[03:39.57]You don't have to tell me
[03:43.74]If you ever think of me
[03:47.85]I know you see me dancing
[03:50.08]Wildly, in the fog of your memory
[03:54.57]You don't have to tell me, I can still believe
