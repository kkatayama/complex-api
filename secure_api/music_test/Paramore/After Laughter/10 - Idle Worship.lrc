[00:08.08]Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
[00:12.36]Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
[00:16.40]And I don't want your money
[00:18.12]If I was you I'd run from me or
[00:20.35]Rip me open you'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
[00:24.54]Be sure to put your faith in something more
[00:28.26]I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
[00:32.23]We all got problems, don't we?
[00:34.27]We all need heroes, don't we?
[00:36.23]But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy
[00:39.92]
[00:39.92]La, la, la, la, la, la, la
[00:46.12]Don't let me let you down
[00:48.75]
[00:48.75]Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
[00:52.69]And if that's what you want
[00:54.61]I hate to let you down
[00:57.01]I got your hopes up
[00:58.68]Now I got you hoping
[01:01.02]That I'm gonna be the one that let you down
[01:07.68]
[01:07.68]Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
[01:11.95]Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
[01:15.90]What if I fall on my face?
[01:17.96]What if I make a mistake?
[01:19.87]If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
[01:23.99]Remember how we used to like ourselves?
[01:27.77]What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
[01:31.71]I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you
[01:35.71]But we could let the light illuminate these hopeless places
[01:39.51]
[01:39.51]La, la, la, la, la, la, la
[01:45.58]Just let me let you down
[01:48.30]
[01:48.30]Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
[01:52.34]And if that's what you want
[01:54.03]I hate to let you down
[01:56.49]I got your hopes up
[01:58.26]Now I got you hoping
[02:00.49]That I'm gonna be the one that let you down
[02:05.58]
[02:05.58]La, la, la, la, la, la, la
[02:13.33]La, la, la, la, la, la, la
[02:19.61]
[02:19.61]Oh, no, I ain't your hero
[02:23.49]You're wasting all your faith on me
[02:27.48]Oh, no, I know where this goes
[02:31.55]Think it's safe to say your savior doesn't look a thing like me
[02:35.20]
[02:35.20]La, la, la, la, la, la, la
[02:40.94]Don't let me let you down
[02:43.82]
[02:43.82]Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
[02:47.86]And if that's what you want
[02:49.53]I hate to let you down
[02:52.08]I got your hopes up
[02:53.70]Now I got you hoping
[02:56.03]That I'm gonna be the one that let you down
[02:59.73]
[02:59.73]Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
[03:03.62]And if that's what you want
[03:05.33]I hate to let you down
[03:07.86]I got your hopes up
[03:09.63]Now I got you hoping
[03:11.69]That I'm gonna be the one that let you down
