[00:12.33]I can't think of getting old
[00:14.83]It only makes me want to die
[00:22.30]And I can't think of who I was
[00:25.17]'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry, cry
[00:31.61]Can't look back, can't look too far ahead
[00:36.81]You got the point, you got the message
[00:42.66]
[00:42.66]I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
[00:47.85]I try to keep going but it's not that simple
[00:52.95]I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
[00:58.18]I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
[01:01.47]Yeah, I'm caught in the middle
[01:14.38]
[01:14.38]I was dreaming life away
[01:17.00]All the while just going blind
[01:24.34]Can't see the forest for the trees
[01:27.40]Behind the lids of my own eyes
[01:33.60]Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help me now
[01:38.97]A dream is good (don't wear it out)
[01:41.13]If you don't wear it out
[01:44.90]
[01:44.90]And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
[01:50.08]I try to keep going but it's not that simple
[01:55.11]I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
[02:00.38]I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
[02:03.73]Yeah, I'm caught in the middle
[02:16.02]
[02:16.02]No, I don't need no help
[02:18.55]I can sabotage me by myself
[02:21.82]I don't need no one else
[02:23.86]I can sabotage me by myself
[02:27.00]I don't need no help
[02:29.04]I can sabotage me by myself
[02:32.25]Don't need no one else
[02:34.35]I can sabotage me by myself
[02:37.61]I don't need no help
[02:39.65]I can sabatoge me by myself
[02:42.81]Don't need no one else
[02:44.87]I can sabotage me by myself
[02:48.08]I don't need no help
[02:50.07]I can sabatoge me by myself
[02:53.04]Don't need no one else
[02:55.11]I can sabotage me by myself
[02:58.63]
[02:58.63]And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
[03:03.96]I try to keep going but it's not that simple
[03:09.05]I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
[03:14.25]Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
[03:17.76]Yeah I'm caught in the middle
[03:22.99]
[03:22.99]I'm caught in the middle
