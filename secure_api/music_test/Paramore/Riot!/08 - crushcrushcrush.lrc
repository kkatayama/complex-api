[00:17.59]Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all
[00:21.13]
[00:21.13]They taped over your mouth
[00:23.27]Scribbled out the truth with their lies
[00:26.14]Your little spies
[00:28.15]They taped over your mouth
[00:30.13]Scribbled out the truth with their lies
[00:33.19]Your little spies
[00:39.94]
[00:39.94]Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush (two, three, four)
[00:45.68]
[00:45.68]Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
[00:49.42]Just the one two of us is counting on
[00:52.69]That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
[00:56.36]Let's be more than, this
[01:06.47]
[01:06.47]If you wanna play it like a game

[01:52.21]That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
[01:55.93]Let's be more than, this now
[02:06.18]
[02:06.18]Rock and roll baby, don't you know that
[02:09.75]We're all alone now, I need something to sing about
