[00:20.06]Just talk yourself up
[00:22.31]And tear yourself down
[00:29.44]You've built your one wall
[00:31.59]Now find your way around
[00:38.83]What's the problem?
[00:41.36]You've got a lot of nerve
[00:47.74]
[00:47.74]So what did you think I would say?
[00:49.29]No, you can't run away, you can't run away
[00:52.40]So what did you think I would say?
[00:53.85]No, you can't run away, you can't run away
[00:56.21]You wouldn't
[00:58.74]
[00:58.74]I never wanted to say this
[01:03.26]You never wanted to stay
[01:07.90]I put my faith in you, so much faith
[01:11.39]And then you just threw it away
[01:20.32]You threw it away
[01:26.80]
[01:26.80]I'm not so naive
[01:29.05]My sorry eyes can see
[01:36.19]The way you fight shy
[01:38.43]Of almost everything
[01:45.61]Well, if you give up
[01:47.81]You'll get what you deserve
[01:54.36]
[01:54.36]So what did you think I would say?
[01:55.78]No, you can't run away, you can't run away
[01:58.96]So what did you think I would say?
[02:00.45]No, you can't run away, you can't run away
[02:02.84]You wouldn't
[02:04.25]
[02:04.25]I never wanted to say this
[02:08.84]You never wanted to stay
[02:13.50]I put my faith in you, so much faith
[02:16.95]And then you just threw it away
[02:25.89]You threw it away
[02:32.12]
[02:32.12]You were finished long before
[02:36.39]We had even seen the start
[02:40.49]Why don't you stand up, be a man about it?
[02:46.04]Fight with your bare hands about it now
[02:55.90]
[02:55.90]I never wanted to say this
[03:00.34]You never wanted to stay, well did you?
[03:05.22]I put my faith in you, so much faith
[03:08.92]And then you just threw it away
[03:14.53]
[03:14.53]I never wanted to say this
[03:19.17]You never wanted to stay
[03:23.73]And I put my faith in you, so much faith
[03:27.23]And then you just threw it away
