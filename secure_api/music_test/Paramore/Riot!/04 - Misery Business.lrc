[00:28.27]She's got a body like an hourglass, that's ticking like a clock
[00:31.24]It's a matter of time before we all run out
[00:34.16]When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
[00:36.59]I waited eight long months
[00:37.94]She finally set him free
[00:39.37]I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
[00:42.51]Two weeks and we had caught on fire
[00:44.35]She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile
[00:50.60]
[00:50.60]Whoa, I never meant to brag
[00:54.13]But I got him where I want him now
[00:56.24]Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
[00:59.77]To steal it all away from you now
[01:02.65]But God, does it feel so good

[01:07.89]And if you could, then you know you would
[01:10.93]'Cause God, it just feels so

[01:18.39]
[01:18.39]Second chances they don't ever matter, people never change
[01:21.15]Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
[01:24.13]And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
[01:26.71]I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
[01:29.41]Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
[01:32.07]Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
[01:34.91]They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
[01:37.64]Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
[01:43.37]

[01:46.89]But I got him where I want him now
[01:48.96]Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
[01:52.58]To steal it all away from you now
[01:55.39]But God, does it feel so good
[01:57.92]'Cause I got him where I want him right now
[02:00.52]And if you could, then you know you would
[02:03.61]'Cause God, it just feels so
[02:09.54]It just feels so good
[02:16.60]
[02:16.60]I watched his wildest dreams come true
[02:19.27]And not one of them involving you
[02:22.08]Just watch my wildest dreams come true
[02:25.05]Not one of them involving
[02:49.94]
[02:49.94]Whoa, well I never meant to brag
[02:53.32]But I got him where I want him now
[02:55.52]
[02:55.52]Whoa, I never meant to brag
