[00:28.05]And when it rains on this side of town
[00:33.02]It touches everything
[00:40.22]Just say it again and mean it
[00:43.82]
[00:43.82]We don't miss a thing
[00:45.08]You made yourself a bed at the bottom
[00:48.52]Of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
[00:52.23]And convinced yourself
[00:54.21]That it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore
[01:01.03]
[01:01.03]And no, oh
[01:03.81]How could you do it?
[01:05.50]Oh, I
[01:07.75]I never saw it coming
[01:09.49]No, oh
[01:11.89]I need an ending
[01:13.29]So why can't you stay
[01:16.02]Just long enough to explain?
[01:24.77]
[01:24.77]And when it rains
[01:28.39]You always find an escape
[01:32.83]Just running away
[01:36.46]From all of the ones who love you
[01:41.12]From everything
[01:42.90]You made yourself a bed at the bottom
[01:46.43]Of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
[01:49.97]And you'll sleep till May
[01:51.80]You'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore
[01:58.13]
[01:58.13]And no, oh
[02:01.20]How could you do it?
[02:02.85]Oh, I
[02:05.03]I never saw it coming
[02:06.94]No, oh
[02:09.22]I need an ending
[02:11.07]So why can't you stay
[02:13.38]Just long enough to explain?
[02:14.36]
[02:14.36](Explain your side
[02:22.74]Take my side)
[02:31.05]Take these chances to turn it around
[02:34.92]Let's take these chances we'll make it somehow
[02:38.94]And take these chances and turn it around
[02:43.19]Just turn it around
[02:48.96]
[02:48.96]No, how could you do it?
[02:51.89]Oh, I, I never saw it coming
[02:56.21]
[02:56.21]No, oh, how could you do it?
[03:00.24]Oh, I, I never saw it coming
[03:04.31]No, oh, how could you do it?
[03:07.94]Oh, I, I never saw it coming
[03:12.27]No, oh
[03:15.12]I need an ending
[03:16.22]So why can't you stay
[03:18.88]Just long enough to explain?
[03:21.44]
[03:21.44]You can take your time, take my time
