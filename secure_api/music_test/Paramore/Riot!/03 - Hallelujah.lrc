[00:18.64]Somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
[00:25.57]If we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday
[00:32.44]If only time flew like a dove
[00:38.85]We gotta make it fly faster than I'm falling in love
[00:51.72]
[00:51.72]This time we're not giving up
[00:57.75]Let's make it last forever
[01:02.48]Screaming "Hallelujah"
[01:10.48]We'll make it last forever
[01:16.99]
[01:16.99]Holding onto patience, wearing thin
[01:23.14]I can't force these eyes to see the end
[01:29.51]If only time flew like a dove
[01:36.44]We could watch it fly and just keep looking on
[01:48.44]
[01:48.44]This time we're not giving up
[01:55.13]Let's make it last forever
[01:59.44]Screaming "Hallelujah"
[02:07.77]We'll make it last forever
[02:18.91]
[02:18.91]And we've got time on our hands
[02:26.43]And we've got, got nothing but time on our hands
[02:30.02]Got nothing but, got nothing but
[02:32.79]Got nothing but time on our hands
[02:47.18]
[02:47.18]This time we're not giving up
[02:53.98]Oh, let's make it last forever
[02:58.48]Screaming hallelujah (Hallelujah)
[03:06.48]Hallelujah
