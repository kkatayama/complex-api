[00:19.83]I've gone for too long
[00:23.01]Living like I'm not alive
[00:25.70]So I'm gonna start over tonight
[00:29.16]Beginning with you and I
[00:31.52]
[00:31.52]When this memory fades
[00:34.81]I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
[00:37.72]With chances taken, hope embraced
[00:41.20]And have I told you
[00:42.76]
[00:42.76]I'm not going
[00:46.23]'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
[00:50.08]And I'm not leaving
[00:51.38]I won't let you
[00:54.99]Let you give up on a miracle
[00:58.68]When it might save you
[01:02.62]
[01:02.62]We've learned to run from
[01:05.75]Anything uncomfortable
[01:08.53]We've tied our pain below
[01:11.95]And no one ever has to know
[01:14.31]
[01:14.31]That inside we're broken
[01:17.43]I try to patch things up again
[01:19.89]To calm my tears and kill these fears
[01:22.44]But have I told you, have I
[01:26.79]
[01:26.79]I'm not going
[01:30.40]'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
[01:34.18]And I'm not leaving
[01:35.57]I won't let you
[01:39.13]Let you give up on a miracle
[01:42.87]When it might save you
[01:48.33]
[01:48.33]It's not faith if
[01:50.97]If you use your eyes
[01:54.80]You'll lie
[01:56.82]We'll get it right this time (This time)
[01:59.72]Let's leave this all behind
[02:03.75]Oh, I will get it right this time
[02:08.55]It's not faith if you're using your eyes
[02:12.34]Oh, I...
[02:14.72]
[02:14.72]Well I've gone for too long
[02:17.53]Living like I'm not alive
[02:20.35]So I'm gonna start over tonight
[02:24.31]Beginning with you and
[02:26.44]
[02:26.44]I don't want to run from
[02:30.06]Anything uncomfortable
[02:32.26]I just want no
[02:34.73]I just need this pain to end right here
[02:40.62]
[02:40.62]I'm not going
[02:44.03]'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
[02:47.70]And I'm not leaving
[02:49.24]I won't let you
[02:52.82]Let you give up on a miracle
[02:56.57]'Cause it might save you
[02:58.63]
[02:58.63]Yeah, it might save you
[03:08.26]Oh, it might save you
[03:10.98]It's not faith if you
[03:14.82]If you use your eyes
[03:17.57]If you use your eyes
[03:20.89]If you use your eyes
