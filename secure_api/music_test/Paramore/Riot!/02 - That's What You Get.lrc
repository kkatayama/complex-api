[00:11.68]No sir, well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
[00:16.71]It's your turn, so take a seat we're settling the final score
[00:22.64]And why do we like to hurt so much?
[00:27.52]I can't decide
[00:29.94]You have made it harder just to go on
[00:33.31]And why?
[00:35.50]All the possibilities
[00:37.49]Well, I was wrong
[00:42.84]
[00:42.84]That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[00:50.17]That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[00:57.19]I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
[01:04.51]And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[01:22.88]
[01:22.88]I wonder, how am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
[01:28.27]'Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
[01:33.67]I still try, holding on to silly things, I never learn
[01:39.21]Oh, why? All the possibilities
[01:43.56]I'm sure you've heard
[01:48.75]
[01:48.75]That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[01:56.15]That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[02:03.23]I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
[02:10.40]And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[02:18.23]
[02:18.23]Pain, make your way to me, to me
[02:23.40]And I'll always be just so inviting
[02:28.80]If I ever start to think straight
[02:34.12]This heart will start a riot in me
[02:37.88]Let's start, start, hey
[02:40.14]
[02:40.14]Why do we like to hurt so much?
[02:45.12]Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
[02:51.10]
[02:51.10]That's what you get when you let your heart win
[02:55.13]Whoa
[02:58.32]
[02:58.32]That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[03:05.63]That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[03:12.78]
[03:12.78]Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
[03:20.10]And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
