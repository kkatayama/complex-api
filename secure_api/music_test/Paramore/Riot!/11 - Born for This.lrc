[00:13.93]Oh no, I just keep on falling (Back to the same old)
[00:18.77]And where's hope, when misery comes crawling? (Oh my way, eh)
[00:24.12]With your fate, you'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
[00:29.15]To kill off this common sense of mine
[00:33.40]
[00:33.40]And it takes acquired minds
[00:36.57]To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
[00:39.28]You can't down it with your eyes
[00:41.90]So we don't need the headlines
[00:44.46]We don't need the headlines, we just want
[00:47.79]We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back
[00:52.95]
[00:52.95]Everybody sing
[00:56.02]Like it's the last song you will ever sing
[01:00.44]Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?
[01:03.28]Everybody live
[01:06.35]Like it's the last day you will ever see
[01:10.85]Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?
[01:16.30]
[01:16.30]Right now, you're the only reason (I'm not letting go, oh)
[01:21.38]And time out, if everyone's worth pleasing (Well ha)
[01:27.47]You'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
[01:31.62]To kill off the finite state of mind
[01:35.58]
[01:35.58]And it takes acquired minds
[01:38.66]To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
[01:41.53]You can't down it with your eyes
[01:44.06]So we don't meet the headlines
[01:46.60]No, we don't want your headlines, we just want
[01:49.86]We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back
[01:55.17]

[02:08.65]Like it's the last day you will ever see
[02:13.10]Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?
[02:16.05]Everybody sing
[02:19.04]Like it's the last song you will ever sing
[02:23.45]Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure?
[02:39.09]
[02:39.09]Alright, so you think you're ready?
[02:41.50]OK, then you say this with me, go
[02:44.24]We were born for this (we were born for this)
[02:49.11]
[02:49.11]Alright, so you think you're ready?
[02:51.89]OK, then you say this with me, go
[02:54.65]We were born for this (we were born for this)
[02:59.52]We were born for this (we were born for this)
[03:04.80]We were born for, we were born for
[03:10.55]
[03:10.55]Everybody sing
[03:13.63]Like it's the last song you will ever sing
[03:17.94]Tell me, tell me can you feel the pressure?
