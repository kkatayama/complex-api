[00:09.43]I'm sitting in a room
[00:11.14]Made up of only big white walls
[00:12.98]And in the halls
[00:14.02]There are people looking through the window and the door
[00:16.65]They know exactly what we're here for
[00:19.01]Don't look up, just let them think
[00:21.17]There's no place else you'd rather be
[00:23.50]
[00:23.50]You're always on display
[00:25.18]For everyone to watch and learn from
[00:27.10]Don't you know by now
[00:29.34]You can't turn back
[00:32.29]Because this road is all you'll ever have
[00:38.21]
[00:38.21]And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
[00:42.97]Just living proof that the camera's lying
[00:47.38]And oh, oh open wide
[00:51.43]'Cause this is your night, so smile
[00:55.65]'Cause you'll go out in style
[01:00.52]You'll go out in style
[01:06.51]
[01:06.51]If you let me I could
[01:08.40]I'd show you how to build your fences
[01:10.06]Set restrictions
[01:11.32]Separate from the world
[01:12.67]The constant battle that you hate to fight
[01:14.59]Just blame the limelight
[01:16.06]
[01:16.06]Don't look up just let them think
[01:18.19]There's no place else you'd rather be in now
[01:20.34]You can't turn back
[01:24.54]Because this road is all you'll ever have
[01:30.49]
[01:30.49]And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
[01:35.37]Just living proof that the camera's lying
[01:39.62]And oh, oh open wide
[01:43.46]Cause this is your night, so smile
[01:49.72]
[01:49.72]Yeah, yeah you're asking for it
[01:51.85]With every breath that you breathe in
[01:55.79]Just breathe it in
[01:59.02]Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
[02:01.40]You do all this big talking
[02:03.88]So now let's see you walking
[02:06.49]I said let's see you walking
[02:32.39]
[02:32.39]Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
[02:34.67]You do all this big talking
[02:37.17]So now let's see you walking
[02:39.47]I said let's see you walking
[02:41.93]
[02:41.93]And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
[02:46.55]Just living proof that the camera's lying
[02:50.79]And oh, oh open wide
[02:55.41]Yeah oh, oh open wide
[03:00.21]Yeah oh, oh open wide
[03:03.98]'Cause you'll go out in style
[03:08.93]You'll go out in style
