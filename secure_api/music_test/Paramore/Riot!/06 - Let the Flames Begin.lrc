[00:23.80]What a shame we all became such fragile, broken things
[00:30.92]A memory remains, just a tiny spark
[00:36.30]I give it all my oxygen, to let the flames begin
[00:42.90]To let the flames begin
[00:45.34]
[00:45.34]Oh glory
[00:51.31]Oh glory
[00:53.53]
[00:53.53]This is how we'll dance when
[00:58.40]When they try to take us down
[01:02.47]This is what we'll be, oh glory
[01:06.22]
[01:06.22]Somewhere weakness is our strength, and I'll die searching for it
[01:12.21]I can't let myself regret, such selfishness
[01:17.92]My pain and all the trouble caused, no matter how long
[01:24.43]I believe that there's hope
[01:26.66]
[01:26.66]Buried beneath it all and
[01:32.84]Hiding beneath it all and
[01:38.70]Growing beneath it all and
[01:41.24]
[01:41.24]This is how we'll dance when
[01:46.05]When they try to take us down
[01:50.13]This is how we'll sing oh
[01:53.23]This is how we'll stand when
[01:58.12]When they burn our houses down
[02:01.97]This is what we'll be, oh glory
[02:05.55]
[02:05.55]Reaching as I sink down into light (To light)
[02:17.02]Reaching as I sink down into light (To light)
[02:28.88]
[02:28.88]This is how we dance when
[02:33.92]When they try to take us down
[02:37.72]This is how we'll sing oh
[02:41.17]This is how we'll stand when
[02:45.87]When they burn our houses down
[02:49.67]This is what we'll be, oh glory
