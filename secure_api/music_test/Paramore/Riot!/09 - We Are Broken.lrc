[00:15.08]I am outside
[00:18.23]And I've been waiting for the sun
[00:21.55]With my wide eyes
[00:24.91]I've seen worlds that don't belong
[00:28.25]
[00:28.25]My mouth is dry
[00:31.26]With words I cannot verbalize
[00:35.27]Tell me why
[00:38.22]We live like this
[00:42.08]
[00:42.08]Keep me safe inside
[00:45.79]Your arms like towers
[00:48.80]Tower over me, yeah
[00:55.42]
[00:55.42]Cause we are broken
[00:58.58]What must we do to restore
[01:02.44]Our innocence
[01:05.57]And all the promise we adored?
[01:09.20]Give us life again
[01:12.58]Cause we just wanna be whole
[01:20.03]
[01:20.03]Lock the doors
[01:22.51]Cause I'd like to capture this voice
[01:25.92]It came to me tonight
[01:29.41]So everyone will have a choice
[01:33.08]
[01:33.08]And under red lights
[01:36.28]I'll show myself it wasn't forged
[01:39.79]We're at war
[01:42.94]We live like this
[01:46.64]
[01:46.64]Keep me safe inside
[01:50.65]Your arms like towers
[01:53.62]Tower over me
[02:00.17]
[02:00.17]Cause we are broken
[02:03.40]What must we do to restore
[02:07.09]Our innocence
[02:10.58]And all the promise we adored?
[02:13.91]Give us life again
[02:17.21]Cause we just wanna be whole
[02:23.44]
[02:23.44](Ah, ah)
[02:37.11](Ah) tower over me
[02:43.61](Ah) tower over me
[02:50.90](Ah)
[02:52.79]
[02:52.79]And I'll take the truth at any cost
[02:58.16]
[02:58.16]Cause we are broken
[03:01.18]What must we do to restore
[03:04.83]Our innocence
[03:08.18]And all the promise we adored?
[03:11.81]Give us life again
[03:15.39]Cause we just wanna be whole
